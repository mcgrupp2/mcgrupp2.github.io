### Data Driven Decisions

Thank you for visiting my site, my name is Jason Rupp and I am a Data Scientist living in the Pacific Northwest. I have compiled some code samples from my Master's studies at Southern Methodist University. 

Please feel free to peruse the samples with the above navigation bar. These projects I completed during my Master's, they are in a report type format. The code samples are located at the end of most documents in the appendix section.
