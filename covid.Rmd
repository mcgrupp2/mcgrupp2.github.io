This example is a little less refined in terms of reporting, though I would like to have it present to demonstrate ability. It is a sample of code with sometimes little explanation for each code chunk. The purpose of this project was to forecast the COVID-19 cases for the "next" 7-days and 90-days (from when I turned it in!). The estimate models that were developed performed quite well over the 90 window, as the actual cases for these dates are in the prediction windows from these models. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```


```{r, echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
htmltools::includeHTML('RUPP_Jason-COVID_forcasting.html')
```
