Here is an example of a project which involved replicating a neural network found in a journal article. This was a very challenging exercise, which I would love to expand upon, and get more experience in this domain.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::includeHTML('RUPP_Jason-tf_neuralNet_work_example.html')
```
