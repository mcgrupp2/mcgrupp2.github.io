```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This sample is from a project in which we were to choose a model to make the best prediction. I chose to use extreme gradient boost due to previous success and familiarity. For the report, I did most of the final coding in R with the caret, though I have also included the same process in the python package sci-kit learn.


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
